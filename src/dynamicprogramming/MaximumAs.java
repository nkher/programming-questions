	 * 
	 * a) For N < 7, the output is N itself. b) Ctrl V can be used multiple times to print current buffer (See last two examples above). 
	 * The idea is to compute the optimal string length for N keystrokes by using a simple insight. 
	 * The sequence of N keystrokes which produces an optimal string length will end with a suffix of Ctrl-A, a Ctrl-C, followed by only Ctrl-V's (For N > 6).
	 * 
	 * The task is to find out the break=point after which we get the above suffix of keystrokes. 
	 * Definition of a breakpoint is that instance after which we need to only press Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C once and 
	 * the only Ctrl-Vâ€™s afterwards to generate the optimal length. If we loop from N-3 to 1 and 
	 * choose each of these values for the break-point, and compute that optimal string they would produce. 
	 * Once the loop ends, we will have the maximum of the optimal lengths for various breakpoints, 
	 * thereby giving us the optimal length for N keystrokes.
